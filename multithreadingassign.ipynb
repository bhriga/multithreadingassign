    "Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently. In a simple, single-core CPU, \n",
    "it is achieved using frequent switching between threads. This is termed context switching. In context switching,\n",

    "Context switching takes place so frequently that all the threads appear to be running parallelly\n",
    "\n",
    "Python multithreading enables efficient utilization of the resources as the threads share the data space and memory.\n",

    "5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is a programming technique that allows multiple threads of execution to run concurrently within a single process.\n",
    "While multithreading offers several advantages, it also has some disadvantages. Let's explore both:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "Concurrency: Multithreading allows different parts of a program to execute concurrently, which can lead to improved performance and responsiveness,\n",
    "especially in applications that perform I/O-bound or CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, which makes it easy to share data and resources between threads\n",
    "without the need for complex inter-process communication mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsiveness: Multithreading can enhance the responsiveness of user interfaces by allowing background tasks to execute without blocking\n",
    "the main thread, ensuring that the application remains interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified Design: Multithreading can simplify the design of certain types of applications by allowing you to decompose complex tasks into smaller,\n",
    "independently executing threads, which can lead to cleaner and more modular code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: In systems with multiple CPUs or CPU cores, multithreading can enable parallelism, allowing multiple threads to execute simultaneously\n",
    "and take advantage of the available hardware resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity, as developers need to carefully manage thread synchronization, communication, and coordination\n",
    "to avoid race conditions, deadlocks, and other concurrency-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Overhead: Creating and managing threads incurs overhead in terms of memory and CPU resources. In applications with a large number of threads,\n",
    "this overhead can become significant and impact performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency Bugs: Multithreaded programs are prone to concurrency bugs, such as race conditions and deadlock, which can be difficult to debug and \n",
    "reproduce. Ensuring thread safety and proper synchronization requires careful design and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Platform Dependence: Multithreading behavior may vary across different platforms and operating systems, leading to non-portable code.\n",
    "Platform-specific threading APIs and features may also limit the portability of multithreaded applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Bottlenecks: Poorly designed multithreaded applications may suffer from performance bottlenecks, such as contention for\n",
    "shared resources or excessive context switching, which can degrade overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging Complexity: Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to the non-deterministic nature of concurrency bugs and the\n",
    "difficulty of reproducing them consistently"
